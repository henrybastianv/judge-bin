## Project Description

A smart dustbin with an OLED display that roasts you every time you throw something away. It blends sarcasm, dark humor, and occasional wisdom to turn waste disposal into an oddly personal experience.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)

Waste disposal is boring, and most people donâ€™t think twice about what they throw away. Traditional dustbins are silent, passive, and do nothing to make you more aware (or entertained) about your trash habits. Thereâ€™s no immediate feedbackâ€”no humor, no guilt-trip, no moment of self-reflection.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)

We introduce The Judgy Bin â€” a smart dustbin fitted with an OLED display that delivers sarcastic, witty, or thought-provoking messages whenever you throw something away. Using a microcontroller (ESP32), an ultrasonic sensor detects waste disposal, and the OLED flashes a randomly selected roast from a preloaded list. The result? A trash can that doesnâ€™t just hold your garbage â€” it holds you accountable, roasts your life choices, and occasionally makes you question your existence.
